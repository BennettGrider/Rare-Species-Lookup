# Rare-Species-Lookup
A web app (eventually PWA?) for looking up which rare plant species have been observed in either the county your location is in, or any county you select, as well as possibly the date and other info about the sighting. Can also get info from adjacent counties.
This app is mainly for me to practice using Bootstrap and brush up on Leaflet, and I will possibly connect a Postgres database with Flask in the future.
