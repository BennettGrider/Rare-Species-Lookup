# Rare-Species-Lookup
A web app (eventually PWA?) for looking up which rare plant species have been observed in either the county your location is in, or any county you select, as well as possibly the date and other info about the sighting. Can also get info from adjacent counties.
This app is mainly for me to practice using Bootstrap and brush up on Leaflet, and I will possibly connect a Postgres database with Flask in the future.

TODO:
*****

-Round location accuracy number in result
-Add pictures and descriptions for each species
-Add more PWA features (option to add to home screen as app via web app install banner)
-Add headers for County / Adjacent County columns
-Adjust adjacent county columns to still list vertically on wide screen resolutions
-Improve general styling of rare species lists
-Fix collapse divs sometimes collapsing upwards instead of downwards
-Possibly do better caching of basemap tiles?
-Possibly decrease width of map, to make scrolling less interrupted by the leaflet map?
